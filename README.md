# Electric-Fields-for-Charge-Distributions
Plots the electric fields for various charge distributions. 

Modulo 1 creates: A Multipole with charges of alternating sign, equally spaced around a circle.
Modulo 2 creates: A small ring of charges above a horizontal line of charges.
Modulo 3 creates: Two vertical parallel lines consisting of opposite charges.
Modulo 4 creates: Horizontal line charges and a single point of opposite charge above it

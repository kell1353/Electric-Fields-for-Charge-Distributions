# Electric-Fields-for-Charge-Distributions
Plots the electric fields for various charge distributions. 


Charge multiplier refers to the number of charges that will make up these distributions. The equation is 2^(input of the Charge multiplier). For example, if you input 2 you will have 4 charges that make up each part of these seperate distributions.

Modulo 1 creates: A Multipole with charges of alternating sign, equally spaced around a circle.
\nModulo 2 creates: A small ring of charges above a horizontal line of charges.
\nModulo 3 creates: Two vertical parallel lines consisting of opposite charges.
\nModulo 4 creates: Horizontal line charges and a single point of opposite charge above it
